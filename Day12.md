### 🚀 What is DevOps?

* **DevOps** is a cultural and technical movement that integrates **software development (Dev)** and **IT operations (Ops)**.
* It emphasizes **automation**, **continuous integration**, **continuous delivery (CI/CD)**, and **collaboration** between development and operations teams.
* Goal: Deliver applications faster, with better quality and reliability.

### 👨‍💻 Who is a DevOps Engineer?

* A DevOps Engineer bridges the gap between developers and IT staff.
* Responsibilities include:

  * Automating and optimizing CI/CD pipelines
  * Infrastructure management using code (IaC)
  * Monitoring performance and system health
  * Ensuring system security and scalability
