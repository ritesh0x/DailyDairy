# üîñ Day 14: Cloud Security under DevOps

**üìÖ Date:** July 3, 2025

---

### üß† Topics Covered:

* Cloud security and its role in DevOps
* Service models in cloud computing: IaaS, PaaS, SaaS

### ‚òÅÔ∏è What is Cloud Security?

Cloud security is a set of policies, technologies, and controls deployed to protect cloud-based systems and data. In the context of **DevOps**, cloud security ensures that the CI/CD pipelines, hosted environments, and deployed applications are protected from unauthorized access, breaches, and vulnerabilities.

Cloud security is integrated into DevOps to ensure security at every stage of development, from code integration to production deployment.

### üß± Cloud Service Models:

| Model | Full Form                   | Description                                                                                  |
| ----- | --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| IaaS  | Infrastructure as a Service | Provides virtualized computing resources (e.g., virtual machines, storage). Example: AWS EC2 |
| PaaS  | Platform as a Service       | Offers a platform with OS, development tools, and database. Example: Google App Engine       |
| SaaS  | Software as a Service       | Delivers software over the internet. Example: Gmail, Google Docs                             |

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Amazon Web Services (AWS):

* **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**

  * A virtual server that can run Linux/Windows
  * Used to deploy applications, host websites, and perform computing tasks

* **IAM (Identity and Access Management):**

  * A security feature to control who can access AWS resources
  * Allows users to assign permissions, roles, and policies
  * Essential for managing **secure access** to services and infrastructure

---

### üåê Hosting Websites with Apache2:

* **Apache2** is a widely-used web server to host static and dynamic websites.
* Common usage in cloud environments to:

  * Host web applications
  * Serve frontend websites
  * Handle HTTP requests securely
