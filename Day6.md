# 🔖 Day 6: Network Security, Hierarchy & Subnetting Basics

**🗓️ Date:** June 24, 2025

---

### 🧠 Topics Covered:

* Cybersecurity hierarchy and layers
* Network security concepts (AAA, IAM)
* Network architecture (Access, Distribution, Core Layers)
* Role of a Network Administrator
* Firewall concepts and packet filtering
* Access rules in firewalls
* Subnetting fundamentals
* IP addressing, private IPs, subnet mask, broadcast address

---

### 💻 What I Did:

Today I studied the **hierarchical structure of cybersecurity tasks**, focusing on how different responsibilities fit into various layers of the security framework. I also explored **network security basics** like AAA, IAM, and firewall configuration.

---

### 🔧 Hierarchy in Cybersecurity:

* **Application Layer:**

  * Penetration Testing
  * Vulnerability Assessment
  * Threat Handling

* **Network Security Layer:**

  * Network Design
  * Firewalls & Access Rules
  * AAA (Authentication, Authorization, Accounting)
  * IAM (Identity and Access Management)

---

### 🛍️ Network Design Layers:

1. **Access Layer**: Connects end devices to the network
2. **Distribution Layer**: Policy implementation and routing
3. **Core Layer**: High-speed backbone for data transport

---

### 📄 Key Roles:

* **Network Administrator**: Responsible for configuring and managing network infrastructure, applying access policies, monitoring traffic, and securing the network with firewalls and subnetting.

---

### 🛡️ Firewall Concepts:

* **Packet Filtering Firewall**: Monitors incoming/outgoing packets and allows or blocks them based on access rules.
* **Access Rule Configuration**: Define which IPs, ports, or protocols are allowed or denied.

---

### 📊 Subnetting Concepts:

* **IP Address**: Unique identifier for a device on a network.
* **Private IP Addressing**: Used within internal networks (e.g., 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x)
* **Broadcast Address**: Used to send data to all hosts on a network.
* **Subnet Mask**: Determines network and host portions of an IP address.

---

### 🧠 Key Learnings:

* Different layers in cybersecurity require different roles and tools.
* AAA and IAM are foundational for secure network management.
* A clear network design with firewalls ensures security and scalability.
* Subnetting is crucial for IP management and routing efficiency.
